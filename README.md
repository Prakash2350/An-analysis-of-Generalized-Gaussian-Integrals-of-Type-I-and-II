# An-analysis-of-Generalized-Gaussian-Integrals-of-Type-I-and-II

This repository accompanies the research paper "An Analysis of the Generalized Gaussian Integrals and Gaussian Like Integrals of Type I and II" published in the Journal of Nepal Mathematical Society (Vol. 7, Issue 2, 2024). In this work, we explore a family of integrals related to Gaussian functions, focusing on two distinct types of Gaussian-like integrals:

Type I: 
∫
−
∞
∞
𝑒
−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
2
𝑑
𝑥
∫

​
 e 
−f(x)

 dx
Type II: 
∫
−
∞
∞
𝑒
−

𝑓
(

)
𝑑
𝑥
∫ 
−∞

​
 e 
−x

 f(x)dx, where 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) is a continuous function.
This paper introduces methods to evaluate these integrals, relying on specialized functions, including error functions, complementary error functions, imaginary error functions, and related functions like the Euler-Mascheroni constant, Laurent series, and Fubini’s theorem. The work builds upon the foundations laid by Huang and Dominy in their studies of Gaussian-like functions.
