# An Analysis of the Generalized Gaussian Integrals and Gaussian-Like Integrals of Type I and II

This repository accompanies the research paper "An Analysis of the Generalized Gaussian Integrals and Gaussian Like Integrals of Type I and II" published in the *Journal of Nepal Mathematical Society* (Vol. 7, Issue 2, 2024). In this work, we explore a family of integrals related to Gaussian functions, focusing on two distinct types of Gaussian-like integrals:

1. **Type I**: \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-f(x)^2} \, dx\)
2. **Type II**: \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} f(x) \, dx\), where \(f(x)\) is a continuous function.

This paper introduces methods to evaluate these integrals, relying on specialized functions, including error functions, complementary error functions, imaginary error functions, and related functions like the Euler-Mascheroni constant, Laurent series, and Fubini's theorem. The work builds upon the foundations laid by Huang and Dominy in their studies of Gaussian-like functions.

The repository contains the mathematical analysis, code implementations for evaluating these integrals, and additional resources that help in understanding and extending the research. We encourage contributions and discussions to further enhance the applicability of these techniques in various mathematical and scientific contexts.
